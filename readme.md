`npm install --save @snowcoders/react-unstyled-input save-prefix ~` 

# Parent Library
This component is part of a larger components library, [react-ui-base](https://github.com/snowcoders/react-ui-base). The goal is to keep all the core logic and base css styles in a single location, that way building out new UI component libraries cheaper and faster (and less buggy). 

We highly recommend visiting the react-ui-base repository to understand how to customize the css along with see examples.

You can also view all the components on our demo site https://snowcoders.github.io/react-ui-base/

# This component
This component takes the normal HTMLInputElement and removes all styling from it. Default browser functionality (ex. using the arrow keys to increase and decrease the number if the `type="number"`) along with width is maintained.
